	abstract = {A new combination of a ﬁnite volume discretization in conjunction with carefully designed dissipative terms of third order, and a Runge Kutta time stepping scheme, is shown to yield an eﬀective method for solving the Euler equations in arbitrary geometric domains. The method has been used to determine the steady transonic ﬂow past an airfoil using an O mesh. Convergence to a steady state is accelerated by the use of a variable time step determined by the local Courant member, and the introduction of a forcing term proportional to the diﬀerence between the local total enthalpy and its free stream value.},

	abstract = {We proposed an eﬃcient and robust algorithm to solve the steady Euler equations on unstructured grids. The new algorithm is a Newton-iteration method in which every iteration step is a linear multigrid method using block lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel ({LU}-{SGS}) iteration as its smoother. To regularize the Jacobian matrix of Newtoniteration, we adopted a local residual dependent regularization, as the replacement of the standard time-stepping relaxation technique based on the local {CFL} number. The proposed method can be extended to high order approximations and three spatial dimensions in a nature way. The solver was tested on a sequence of benchmark problems on both quasi-uniform and local adaptive meshes. Fruitful numerical results illustrated the eﬃciency and robustness of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {The theory of non-oscillatory scalar schemes is developed in this paper in terms of the local extremum diminishing ({LED}) principle that maxima should not increase and minima should not decrease. This principle can be used for multi-dimensional problems on both structured and unstructured meshes, while it is equivalent to the total variation diminishing ({TVD}) principle for one-dimensional problems. A new formulation of symmetric limited positive ({SLIP}) schemes is presented, which can be generalized to produce schemes with arbitrary high order of accuracy in regions where the solution contains no extrema, and which can also be implemented on multi-dimensional unstructured meshes. Systems of equations lead to waves traveling with distinct speeds and possibly in opposite directions. Alternative treatments using characteristic splitting and scalar diﬀusive ﬂuxes are examined, together with a modiﬁcation of the scalar diﬀusion through the addition of pressure diﬀerences to the momentum equations to produce full upwinding in supersonic ﬂow. This convective upwind and split pressure ({CUSP}) scheme exhibits very rapid convergence in multigrid calculations of transonic ﬂow, and provides excellent shock resolution at very high Mach numbers.},

	abstract = {The analysis of real-ﬂuid ﬂow have a particular importance for the description of many technological devices that operates with compressible ﬂuids that cannot be described either as perfect gas or as incompressible ﬂuid, such as regenerative cooling system for cryogenic rocket engine. The aim of this study is to introduce the problem of real ﬂuid-dynamics by means of the unsteady one-dimensional Euler equation for a generic, single-phase, compressible ﬂuid. A proper numerical solver based on a ﬁnite-volume, Godunov-type approach, which is second order accurate in space, is presented. Three diﬀerent approximate Riemann solvers, which are the crucial point of the Godunov-type schemes, are extended for the case of real ﬂuids. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the numerical solver are proved on shock-tube experiments for methane in gas, vapor, liquid and supercritical state. Fluid properties are described by means of the high accuracy {MBWR} equation of state.},
