# FEM-NS
This repository is to record my research of the implementation of Finite Element Method in Navier-Stokes Solver. This project is consisted of several parts:
1. [Numerical Methods Research](theory/readme.md)
2. [Implementation of different numerical methods in C++](src/readme.md)
3. [Analysis of convergence and accuracy of different methods](results/readme.md)

# To-do List
- [ ] Research in Numerical Methods applied in popular CFD solvers
