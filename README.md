# FEM-NS
This repository is to record my research of the implementation of Finite Element Method in Navier-Stokes Solver. Also, my final projects of two courses in Spring 2022, APMA 4301 Numerical Method for PDEs and ENMEE6364 Nonlinear Computational Mechanics, are going to base on this repository. Navier-Stokes Solver is the final target of this target, but there are also some small targets along the roadmap. Details are listed below:

1. [Numerical Methods Research]
2. [Implementation of different numerical methods in Euler Equation]
3. [Analysis of convergence and accuracy of different methods]
4. [Implementation of nonlinear iterative method in diffusion equation]
5. [Operator Separation of Navier-Stokes Solver]
